# Methodology
On Sept. 23, 2021, NPR requested records for all licensed practical nurses and registered nurses who applied for licensure from 2019 to 2021 from 54 nursing boards, including every state and the District of Columbia. (California, Louisiana and West Virginia have separate RN and LPN boards.)

We asked for each nurse's:

* name
* city
* state
* license type (RN or LPN)
* license duration (temporary or permanent)
* application type (by exam, exam-retest, endorsement, renewal, reinstatement, etc.)
* application status 
* relevant dates (application submission, date when all required documents received, license issuance date and license expiration date). 

California and Virginia provided anonymized records, citing the nurses' privacy, and Connecticut and Virginia couldn't provide details on application type.

States responded as follows: 

**Thirty-three boards granted NPR's request**: 

* Arkansas
* California *(provided anonymized records - charged $60.17)*
* Colorado 
* Connecticut
* Hawaii *(only Feb. 2021 onward because of system migration)*
* Illinois
* Indiana
* Iowa 
* Kentucky 
* Louisiana *(LPN board only)*
* Maine
* Massachusetts 
* Michigan 
* Minnesota 
* Mississippi 
* Montana 
* Nebraska 
* New Hampshire *(redacted city/state)*
* New Jersey 
* New Mexico 
* North Carolina *(charged $875)* 
* Ohio 
* Oklahoma 
* Oregon 
* Pennsylvania 
* South Carolina 
* Texas *(only June 2020 onward because of system migration)* 
* Tennessee *(charged $554)* 
* Vermont 
* Virginia *(provided anonymized records - charged $134)*
* West Virginia *(RN board only)*
* Wyoming *(RN board only)*

**Five boards provided partial data**:

* Alabama provided unusable records
* Four boards provided processing time summaries that NPR could not independently verify:
  + Arizona
  + Idaho
  + Missouri
  + Nevada 

**Two boards did not respond to repeated requests for records**:

* Kansas
* West Virginia (LPN board only)

**Ten boards denied NPR's request**:

* Alaska: Told NPR they have no way to export application dates from their database.
* Delaware: "A public body in Delaware is not required to construct a record that does not previously exist for the purpose of fulfilling a FOIA request."  
* District of Columbia: Told NPR they have no way to export application dates from their database.
* Florida: Initially claimed no responsive records exist. When NPR pointed out annual reports advertise license processing times, the Florida Department of Health charged NPR $150, but has not provided any records to NPR as of March 10, 2022.
* New York: Withheld application dates as invasion of nurses' privacy. NPR's appeal was denied Jan. 10, 2022.
* Maryland: Quoted $213 to provide the records, but a recent system hack prevented the board from providing them.
* Rhode Island: "There are no currently existing records that are responsive to the request."
* South Dakota: Told NPR they have no way to export application dates from their database.
* Utah: The board "is not required to compile, format, manipulate, package, summarize, or tailor information in order to fulfill a request."
* Washington: "Per WAC 44-14-04003 (6) No duty to create records, we do not have anything containing the above highlighted information." 

**Four boards wanted fees that NPR did not pay**:

* Georgia ($434,178)
* Louisiana (RN board only-$1,754)
* North Dakota ($25)
* Wisconsin ($600)

Some boards use different terms for the same idea. For example, licensed practical nurses can also be called licensed vocational nurses, and states refer to licensed nurses applying in a new state as "endorsement" or "reciprocity." NPR standardized these terms among the 32 states' records and combined them into one dataset. 

The first states to respond to NPR's request provided records through Sept. 23, 2021, so NPR removed all records after that date from subsequent states to standardize the timeframe. This resulted in a final dataset containing over 226,000 nurses issued new, permanent licenses in 2021.

NPR subtracted the application date from the license issue date to calculate each nurse's processing time in days. We removed 77 nurses' records showing an issue date earlier than their application date, apparently in error. NPR then grouped by state, license type and application type to find median processing times for each of the four major types and to count how many of the nurses' processing times stretched longer than three months, six months, etc.

# Import state data

## Import Arkansas 
* Includes Endorsement, Exam, International (3), Renewal (200), Retest (600) 
* Includes temporary licenses (split by endorsement and examination)
* No pending applications provided

Arkansas doubled names, one temp permit and one permanent license.

## Import California
California provided anonymized records with an entity_id to identify each individual. Each nurse has multiple rows, one for each stage of their application process. This code creates one row for each person, so we can calculate total processing time from the start of stage one until the license was issued.

* VNs by exam progress through three stages called Exam Request, Exam Results and Initial. See MILLER, SYDNEY NICOLE for proof at <https://search.dca.ca.gov/details/4301/VN/704727/97585d1c86321b5b232e49d5c7a65d38> She is the only VN license from AGUANGA, CA issued from 2019 through 2021. The Initial date approved matches her issuance date (May 23, 2019).

* VNs by endorsement progress through two stages called Endorsement and Initial. See CERDA, CHRYSTAL E of Yermo, CA (entity number: 4016139) Initial date matches (May 21, 2019).

* RNs by exam progress through two stages: Request for "RN Exam" and "Apprvd Exm App - Pendng Exm Pass Rslts." See STEELE, ALEXIS ANNE LOUISE for proof at <https://search.dca.ca.gov/details/4001/RN/95252157/31b623dd5e52fbc5ee0778f0edaa5cac> Only RN from ALTAVILLE, CA issued 2019-2021. Her Apprvd Exm App - Pendng Exm Pass Rslts date approved matches her issuance date (July 8, 2021).

* Includes pending applications
* Reactivations don't calculate correctly
* From Rebecca Fuhrman (general counsel) with PA DOS: *Above or Below Threshold applies to an application to reactivate or reinstate a license. Below threshold would apply to a reactivation/reinstatement where the license has been expired/inactive/suspended for less than 5 years. Above threshold would apply to reactivation/reinstatement applications where the license has been expired/inactive/suspended for 5 or more years, in which case the continued competency requirements of Sections 21.30a, 21.156a, 21.332a, and 21.725 of the Board's regulations apply.*

# Examine dataset

How many have negative process times? This happens when the issue date is before the application date.

* 565,797 rows
* 98% of these negative times are renewal/reinstatement (555,127)
```{r}

  #arrange (desc(n))
```

25.8% of data is renewals/reinstatements I cannot use because they have negative process times.
```{r}
nrow(all_data2 %>% filter (process_time2 < 0) %>%
  filter ((str_detect(app_type, "^Renewal")|str_detect(app_type, "^Reinstatement")))) / nrow(all_data2)

0.5% of other types has negative process time and cannot be used -- input errors.
```{r}
nrow(all_data2 %>% filter (process_time2 < 0) %>%
  filter (!(str_detect(app_type, "^Renewal")|str_detect(app_type, "^Reinstatement")))) / nrow(all_data2)  
```

How many process times didn't calculate? (because denied, withdrawn, etc.)

* 44,637 rows
* 2.1% of data did not calculate due to a missing application date.
```{r}

Remove data points after Sept. 23, 2021, to standardize the timeframe among all states. This code removes any licenses issued or applications filed after that date.

* Removes 64,239 applications after Sept 23, 2021, when first states sent records
* Removes 154,981 licenses issued after Sept 23, 2021.

Group by state, license type, application type and year to find state medians, means and counts. Also count how many took longer than a month (30 days), two months, three months, etc.

This code also creates separate dataframes breaking records down on by license type (RN or LPN) and all new nurses as one lumped group (excluding renewals, reinstatements, exam-retest).

Most states didn't provide applications before Jan. 1, 2019, meaning 2019's data is incomplete since those licensed through the first months of 2019 likely applied in late-2018. Additionally, Hawaii, Oklahoma, Texas and Maine didn't provide any records from 2019.

This code looks for endorsement nurses licensed by these 30 states in 2021, as well as currently pending applications from the 20 states that provided pending records. It re-runs a bit of code so as to include those additional records after Sept. 23 because I'm not comparing state to state but the nation as a whole. 

* 105,543 licensed by endorsement in 2021; 
* 41,343 pending (Jan 2021-Dec 2021) 
* 146,886, but this is a serious undercount since it only includes 30 states, only through September 2021 for most.

## Compare 2020 to 2021
Not sure I can use change from 2020-2021 for some states where I didn't get 2019-2021, like Texas, Maine, etc.

* Ohio RN endorsement median increased from 63 days to 119 (56-day jump)
* Ohio LPN endorsement median increased from 51 days to 106 (55-day jump)
* PA RN endorsement median increased from 57 days (in 2020) to 90 (in 2021) (33-day jump)
* PA LPN endorsement median increased from 82 days to 126 (44-day jump)

Some large decreases, too 

* NJ RN endorsement median decreased from 65 days to 49 (16-day drop)
* NJ LPN endorsement median decreased from 66 days to 52 (14-day drop)
* KY LPN endorsement median decreased from 44 days to 27 (22-day drop)

## Histograms-weeks to license
Create histograms of each state's number of weeks to license by license type and application type. Optionally, save graphs of each

This code converts processing time to weeks, rounding up for any portion of a week

  mutate (#week_count = round(as.numeric(process_time2/7)), #will round down if below 0.5
          week_count = ceiling(as.numeric(process_time2/7))) %>% #always round up
#  rename (week_count = process_time2) %>%
  filter (year=="2021") %>%
  count (data_state, lic_type, standard_app_type, week_count) #, median21

# National scope
What percent of American nurses are represented by these 32 states' data? 

Approx 65% of nurse licenses nationally, using counts of active licenses as a proxy for new nurse applications. Getting Florida's records would add 6%, but they had not provided records by March 10, 2022.

# Fact-check Virginia's claims
*Article text: "In Virginia, the Board of Nursing reports that it processes 99% of applications within 30 days. ... If you start the clock at the point nurses submitted an application, NPR's analysis of Virginia's records shows just 1 in 4 licenses were issued within 30 calendar days, well below the 99% figure."*

*"The reason for the discrepancy: The board doesn't start its clock until an application is marked 'complete,' meaning all materials are in and ready for review."*

In va_state, docs_time records days from being marked complete. 

This code confirms their 99% claim within 30 days of getting marked complete, but also shows only 24.2% of the applications were issued within 30 calendar days from their submission.

```{r}

             docs_within_30 = sum(docs_time <= 30),
             docs_pct = docs_within_30 / count)

# Analyze California
*Article text: "California’s records show registered nurses moving in from other states (known as “endorsement” licenses) waited about two months if they submitted everything necessary on the first go. But only one-quarter of nurses did that. The remaining three-quarters – more than 12,300 nurses – were marked “deficient,” which doubled the processing time."*

This code creates a histogram showing differences in counts and time to issuance for California's deficient vs complete applications.

Among all 2021's applications: (not just those licensed)

* 18720 RN endorsements were deficient (63% of all applications)
* 10831 (37% were complete)
* 1092 LPNs were deficient (68%)
* 506 LPNs were complete (32%)

Exams are better, probably because schools help with applications

* 61% of LPN exams complete
* 65% of RN exams complete
